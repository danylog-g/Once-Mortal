                <strong>The Realm</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; A standard high-fantasy setting with sprawling human kingdoms, 
                ancient elven forests, dwarven mountain strongholds, orcish hordes on the steppes, scattered monster threats (goblins, trolls, occasional dragons). 
                Magic exists (wizards, clerics, enchanted items) but isn't as widespread as the feywild. 
                Through Garna joining the Astral Sea they got access to the technology of gunpowder. 
                Which is widely adopted. Technology level sits around early Renaissance to early Wild West: 
                matchlocks, wheellocks, flintlocks, early revolvers, blunderbusses, and basic cannons are used by those who don't know magic. 
                Plate armor is still used but declining in effectiveness.

                <strong>Humans</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Humans embraced firearms fastest and most broadly. 
                Kingdoms field regiments of musketeers alongside pikemen and cavalry. 
                Flintlock pistols are common sidearms for officers, nobles, and adventurers. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; City guards carry pistols and muskets. 
                Frontier settlers and rangers favor rifles for hunting and defense. 
                Cavalry uses carbines and pistols for hit-and-run tactics. 
                Cannons defend city walls and bombard castles. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Firearms began democratizing warfare and personal defense, 
                lessening the absolute dominance of the heavily armored knight or the battle-trained noble. 
                A farmer with a musket can kill a knight. <br>

                <strong>Dwarves</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Dwarves don't just use firearms; they perfect them. 
                Their forges produce the most reliable, accurate, and durable guns in the world. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Prefer heavy, powerful rifles and revolving hand-cannons. 
                Excelled in developing fortification-cracking cannons and intricate mechanical firing mechanisms 
                (superior wheellocks, early reliable revolvers). <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Dwarven infantry lines are terrifying. 
                Heavily armored, shielded ranks presenting unbreakable walls of pikes, 
                backed by ranks firing devastatingly precise volleys from superior rifles. 
                Tunnel fighting involves blunderbusses and short-barreled revolvers. <br>

                <strong>Elves</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Many traditionalist elves disdain the noise, smoke, and "crudeness" of firearms, preferring bows and magic. 
                Pragmatists, however, recognize their utility. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Elves who use firearms favor finely crafted, beautiful, incredibly accurate long rifles. 
                Used for elite sharpshooting, scouting, and hunting dangerous beasts at extreme ranges. 
                Often intricately engraved and magically enhanced for silence or accuracy. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Elf riflemen act as deadly skirmishers and scouts, picking off key targets from concealed positions before fading away. 
                Rarely engage in massed volley fire. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Orcs</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Orcs love the sheer stopping power and terror of firearms but lack patience for intricate crafting or maintenance. 
                They prefer large-bore, short-range weapons. Like blunderbusses, crude hand-cannons, pistols (often used in pairs or as clubs after firing). 
                Cannons are prized siege weapons, used indiscriminately. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Orc charges often involve a terrifying (if inaccurate) volley of massive projectiles at close range before closing for melee. 
                Firearms add brutal shock to their traditional ferocity. <br>
