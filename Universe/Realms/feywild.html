                <strong>The Realm</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; This realm is a hyper-saturated, 
                magically dense Feywild, but utterly devoid of the usual chaotic menagerie 
                (no satyrs, pixies, sprites, hags, etc.). 
                Instead, vast, impossibly vibrant forests, crystalline rivers, radiant meadows, and shimmering glades stretch endlessly. 
                The magic here is potent, focused entirely on growth, beauty, and subtle illusions. 
                It feels curated, not wild. The only inhabitants are Elves and High-Elves.
            </p>

            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Laeto: City of High-Elves</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; A colossal, breathtaking metropolis seemingly grown from polished moonstone, living crystal, and enchanted gold.
                Everything within Laeto is designed for opulent comfort and aesthetic perfection. 
                Streets are pristine, air is perpetually scented, ambient music plays from unseen sources. 
                Food is magically conjured feasts; clothing is woven from starlight and spider silk. 
                Manual labor is non-existent, handled by intricate magic or bound nature spirits (the only non-Elves allowed, treated as invisible tools). <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Sun Elves reside in the sun-drenched upper districts (even at night, magically illuminated). 
                They focus on performance arts grand operas sung with voice-enhancing magic, 
                intricate dances defying physics, sculpting light into temporary masterpieces, composing ever-more complex symphonies. 
                Their lives are a constant, dazzling display. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Moon Elves inhabit the cooler, more subdued, star-lit districts. 
                They focus on intellectual and refined pursuits, 
                like profound philosophical debates, complex magical theorems, writing epic poetry stored in crystal libraries, 
                directing elaborate magical plays exploring historical or abstract concepts. 
                Their luxury manifests as profound quiet, perfect study environments, and access to immense knowledge. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Wild Elves</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Live outside Laeto's walls, 
                integrated deeply into the untamed (but still Elven-only) Feywild forests, mountains, and rivers. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Prefer building subtle, organic dwellings, like tree-houses woven into canopies, 
                grottoes enhanced with living vines, glades magically sheltered but open to the elements. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; They are masters of natural magic: 
                growth, healing, animal kinship, weather whispering. 
                Live in smaller, communal groups focused on harmony with their environment, not dominion over it. <br>

            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Racism</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Elves are viewed with utter contempt by High-Elves of both stripes. 
                Considered primitive, uncouth "savages" who wallow in dirt. 
                Called derogatory names ("Root-Grubbers," "Barefoots," "Wildings"). 
                Their lifestyle is seen as a deliberate insult to High-Elven refinement and superiority. 
                Any interaction is laced with disgust and condescension. 
                Wild Elves entering Laeto face open hostility and are often magically barred or harassed by guards. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The racism extends to any non-Elf. 
                High-Elves universally believe all other races (humans, dwarves, orcs, etc.) are crude, 
                filthy, intellectually stunted, and magically inferior mammals. 
                Tales from the Lesser Realms are told as horror stories or crude comedies. 
                The mere idea of another race entering their realm would provoke revulsion and likely immediate, 
                magically violent expulsion or destruction. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Laeto's borders are magically enforced. 
                Resources from the wild regions (rare magical herbs, pristine water, 
                powerful crystals) are often harvested (via magic or discreet, disdainful emissaries) for Laeto's use, with no regard for the Wild Elves living there. 
                The High-Elves believe they have an inherent right to everything in the realm. <br>
