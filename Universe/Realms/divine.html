                <strong>The Realm</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; A vast, layered dimension existing beyond the mortal planes. 
                Reality here is shaped by belief, concept, and raw divine power. 
                It's fundamentally divided into three distinct, coexisting sections.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Celestial Heaven</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Realm of perfected order, eternal peace (as defined by its rulers), 
                and rewarded mortal souls who aligned with "Lawful Good" ideals in life. 
                It is an endless, impossibly beautiful landscapes of light, crystal, serene gardens, and majestic, 
                harmonious architecture. Pain and suffering are absent. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The inhabitants are Angels, Archons, and other Celestials of pure law and good. 
                Souls of the righteous dead exist in blissful, structured contentment. 
                Focus on contemplation, service, and maintaining cosmic harmony.
                Views the Infernal Hell as an abomination and necessary containment for irredeemable evil. 
                Supports the Devils in the Blood War only as the lesser of two evils to prevent demonic chaos from spreading. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Infernal Hell</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Realm of punishment, temptation, and the eternal, self-destructive conflict. 
                It is a nightmarish landscapes of fire, ice, jagged rock, fetid swamps, and impossibly vast, oppressive fortresses. 
                Torment is environmental and systemic. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Demons come in hordes of ever-spawning, destructive fiends from the Abyss. 
                Motivated by pure chaos, destruction, and inflicting suffering. 
                No overarching strategy beyond annihilation. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Highly organized, militaristic fiends from the Nine Hells. 
                Motivated by tyranny, corruption, and the acquisition of power/souls through contracts. 
                Fight the demons to prevent the Abyss from consuming everything, 
                including their own meticulously structured evil. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>The City</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The dwelling place and social/political center for most deities (
                excluding those fully embedded in Heaven/Hell or primal forces). <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; It is an impossibly vast, ever-shifting cityscape reflecting countless divine aesthetics. 
                Golden spires float beside primordial forests, crystalline palaces overlook volcanic forges, 
                serene lakes border astral libraries. Reality bends to accommodate divine will. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Divided into distinct Divine Quarters representing different Pantheons, 
                each reflecting their Gods' themes. Connecting these are Common Areas. 
                Neutral zones resembling vast, opulent mortal cities. 
                Low ranking Celestials and Fiends act as servants in these neutral zones. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The atmosphere is generally peaceful but filled with constant bickering. 
                Petty squabbles over followers, perceived slights, domain boundaries, 
                and aesthetic choices are common. Open violence is rare and heavily frowned upon 
                (often drawing collective censure), as it destabilizes the divine order. 
                It's a place of intricate politics, alliances, rivalries, and divine ennui.

                <strong>Divine Caste System</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Elder Gods are the oldest, most powerful creator deities. 
                They are the top of the hierarchy. Aloof, inscrutable, rarely engage in petty politics. 
                Dwell in vast, isolated domains within the Gods' Area or beyond it. 
                View others with detached curiosity or mild disdain. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Natural Gods are major deities governing broad, essential concepts. 
                The ruling class of the Gods' Area. They hold significant power, 
                own the grandest palaces in the Divine Quarters, dominate the politics and bureaucracy. 
                Look down on those below. They have full access to all Common Areas and facilities. 
                Their word carries significant weight. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Wild Gods are deities which rose to Godhood and are well known in two or more Realms.
                They are viewed as uncouth, unpredictable, and "lesser" by Natural Gods. 
                Often treated like eccentric country cousins or potentially dangerous savages. 
                Access to the City is severely restricted. 
                May be granted temporary visas for specific business 
                (e.g., petitioning for a follower, attending a rare pantheon summit). 
                Often confined to less desirable parts of the Common Areas or specific "Wild" enclaves. 
                Feel like outsiders. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Local Gods are deities who rose to Godhood in one Realm, City, Town, etc.
                They are the bottom rung. Often mocked or ignored. 
                Seen as barely divine, more like potent fey or nature spirits who got lucky. 
                They have close to no access. Gaining entry to the Gods' Area is a monumental, 
                rare event requiring powerful sponsorship. 
                Usually only experience it as fleeting visitors or petitioners, utterly overwhelmed. 
                They are tourists in the realm of the truly divine. <br>
