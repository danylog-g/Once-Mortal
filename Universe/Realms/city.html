                <strong>The Cityscape</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The streets are a mess. Wide avenues suddenly dead-end into blank walls. 
                Narrow alleys twist between buildings so tall you can't see the top.
                Bridges arch over surprisingly shallow canals. Large plazas appear randomly, usually empty and exposed. 
                Visibility is always poor due to thick, grey fog clinging to the streets, muffling sound. 
                The towering buildings block most natural light, leaving the streets in perpetual gloom, broken only by the harsh artificial lights of the clock towers and street lamps. 
                The constant six-hour reset causes everything to feel repetitive and disorienting.

                <strong>The People</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; People arrive here by accident, pulled from anywhere: farms, warships, 
                libraries, their beds, city streets, fron any realm and at any time. 
                They appear inside the supply clock towers, the only safe zones. 
                Getting out is nearly impossible; only rare magic or artifacts like plane-shift scrolls work. 
                These people are stuck. They become scavengers. 
                They stay near the clock towers for safety and the essential supplies that appear every six hours: 
                food packets, water, basic med-kits, advanced weapons, and people. 
                Outside the towers, they hole up in the lower floors of hollow buildings. 
                Resources are scarce beyond the tower drops. Water sources are unreliable. Trust is rare. 
                Groups form for protection, but tensions run high over supplies, territory near the towers, or control of the better weapons. 
                Hoarders clash with those who want to share. Lone survivors hide, paranoid. 
                The constant fear isn't just the predators; 
                it's the crushing isolation, the loss of their old lives, and the grinding hopelessness of the endless, lifeless city.

                <strong>The Stalkers</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The main threats are the Stalkers. 
                No one knows what they look like clearly but reports conflict. They are ambush hunters. 
                They use the city itself: hiding in the ever-present fog, inside buildings 
                (often resetting with the structure), on rooftops, in the sewers, or deep in alley shadows. 
                They track survivors silently, sometimes for hours, using the fog and urban noise to mask their approach. 
                They seem to enjoy causing fear, often herding prey into traps or dead-ends. 
                Attacks are sudden and brutal, launched from any direction: a sewer grate, a rooftop, 
                around a corner, or straight out of the fog. They strike fast and vanish. 
                Victims often just disappear; sometimes there's blood or dropped items, 
                usually cleaned up by the next reset. Their motives are unknown. They leave no trace. 
                Their presence makes any travel beyond the immediate tower zone dangerous, 
                requiring weapons, groups, and constant vigilance against the fog and shadows. 
                They are the primary reason the towers are the only real refuge.
