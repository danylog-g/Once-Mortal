                <strong>Cityscape</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Endless City is dense, and seemingly stretches infinitely in all directions. It is a chaotic labyrinth of hollow buildings which touch the skies, 
                roads which lead nowhere, bridges crossing relatively shallow waters, claustrophobic alleys, and large empty plazas.
                The majority of the city goes through a "reset" every six hours. Buildings get repaired, litter cleaned, toilets flushed, beds made, vehicles fueled.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; People are, often involuntarily, drawn into the Endless City from almost anywhere.
                Arrival occurs exclusively within the supply clock towers. Those swallowed by the city are effectively trapped, unless they obtain a scroll of plane-shift, or shift planes using a high level spell.
                These supply clock towers, are massive structures which are indestructable. These towers act as safe zones from the creatures which wander in the city.
                Every six hours the clock towers manifest supplies. They are one of the very few ways to get food, water, and medical basics.
                Among the supplies are weapons. Decades ahead of the current weaponry the Realms are used to.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The predators of the people imprisoned within the Endless City, are entities known as stalkers.
                They hunt via ambush, hiding in the fog of the city while trailing the people trapped inside.
                They can be anywhere, the sewers, wandering the streets, inside of buildings, or lurking on the rooftops.
                It is unknown what they look like, or how they ended up in the city.
