        "Every campaign is the same: promises of liberation, rivers of blood, and silence when the banners burn away.",
        "Our generals call us heroes. Our families call us missing. The truth is we are neither—we are ash scattered on borrowed ground.",
        "Weapons sharpen faster than peace. By the time we master one machine of death, another demands our labor.",
        "The Gods do not need armies. They need graveyards. We oblige them.",

        "Centuries ago the mountains could shelter us... The mountains have been paved, a Titan had a bad dream...",
        "The Titans cause chaos, just by waking from their slumber... The Giants cause chaos by playing with eachother... We starve.",
        "The Titans laugh when the avalanches bury us... We mine their bones for weapons...",

        "The towers provide for us, every six hours... Making us complacent... We are a farm for the stalkers...",
        "The real danger is not the stalkers, or the others trapped... It is hope... That one day, there may be escape...",
        "Every dawn is the same... Every dusk is the same... But my scars multiply... How many loops can one body hold?",
        "The city eats our names... I wrote mine on stone... Tomorrow it will vanish too.",

        "The rivers are filled with blood... They whisper names... Always names I once knew...",
        "The trees whisper in voices I recognize... They beg for release... They beg for death...",
        "The stars went out one by one... Until only silence was left to guide us.",
        "I woke to find my shadow grinning... It knew what I would do before I did...",
        "The trees do not grow leaves anymore. They hang heavy with tongues, whispering confessions no one asked to hear.",
        "We no longer bury the dead. The soil spits them back, bloated and restless, as if the earth itself refuses our company.",
        "Every path is lined with corpses of beasts that never existed. Their shapes dissolve when touched, but the stench lingers forever.",
        "The rivers run red, but not with blood alone. Memories swirl in the current. Drink too deeply, and you drown in your own past.",
        "They say the sky cracked open once. Light tried to break through. What fell instead were locusts the size of hounds.",
        "The miracle fruit grows from the blackened roots of a dead god. One bite staves off hunger, sickness, and madness. Two bites hollow you out, until you are a walking husk with eyes full of nothing.",
        "Those who hoard the fruit build kingdoms of bones. Those who share it live long enough to be betrayed.",
        "I saw a mother cradle her child’s corpse beneath the miracle tree. By dawn, the child was breathing again. By dusk, he was gnawing on her arm.",
        "The fruit keeps us alive, but it never makes us whole. The longer you taste it, the less human you remember being.",
        "Silence blankets the fields where we once prayed. Only the miracle trees still sing, and their song is hunger.",
        "Once there were roads through the Realm. Now the stones we walk on scream when stepped upon.",
        "Some survivors peel their own skin away, convinced the nightmare is hiding underneath. The horror is that they are right.",
        "The fruit is called a blessing, but it is grown from suffering. Every harvest stains the ground with new graves.",
        "No one remembers the first bite. Everyone remembers the craving after. It gnaws louder than hunger, sharper than grief.",
        "The stars abandoned us. What we see above are not constellations, but the eyes of things waiting for us to falter.",
        "Our priests tell us the fruit was the last gift of a forgotten deity. The heretics say it is the bait of a predator too vast for us to imagine.",
        "It is a mercy when the fruit tree wilts. A village dies, yes, but at least the craving dies with them.",
        "There are men who will cut out their own hearts if it means planting a seed in the corpse. Some seeds take root. Some do not. The men scream all the same.",
        "The miracle fruit saved us from extinction. It did not save us from despair. The Realm itself makes sure of that.",
        "I dreamt of a harvest where the fruit turned to ash in my hands. I woke with my mouth full of soil, and the taste was sweeter."

        "The Leviathans hide is carpet for our flagship now! Its final scream bought us twenty rounds! A toast, to Bahgyel's next masterpiece!",
        "The Sea laughs at us, and we laugh back louder. Every storm, every monster, every cursed song in the waves—glory or death, and both taste the same.",
