                        <p>
                            <strong>Environment</strong> <br>
                            - An infinitely expanding purple ocean.<br>
                            - A sky devoid of sun and stars.<br>
                            - Some of the only light present on the Astral Sea is bioluminescence from algea, and animals.<br>
                            - The remainder is the golden lightning strikes which occur in the clouds, and artificially created light.<br>
                            - The creatures native to the Sea defy logic, and those who call the Sea a home, defy logic as well.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Creation</strong> <br>
                            - The Astral Sea is a Realm which expands infinitely in all directions. <br>
                            - It exists outside space, time, and logic. <br>
                            - It "pulls" Realms from beyond it and confines them to exist within the network of Realms connected to it. <br>
                            - - Each Realm exists as an appendage of the Astral Sea. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Theories</strong> <br>
                            - There are many creation theories behind the Astral Sea.  <br>
                            - It is a topic that has been studided and explored in exhaustive detail by scholars from all the Realms. <br>
                            - The most poular theories involve the idea of near-omnipotent creators. <br>
                            - These theories are popular and have some merit because all the Realms which connect to the Astral Sea have initial similarities. <br>
                            - - The knowledge, science, and magic is all in a state far below that of the other Realms.  <br>
                            - - The Realm is usually in a state of damage, either post-war, or post-natural-disaster. <br>
                            <strong>></strong> Blessing of the Gods <br>
                            - The most popular theory is the theory that the Gods of the Divine Realm created the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - The Gods scour outside the unvierse in search of Realms which require help, and are willing to accept the grace of the Gods. <br>
                            - The Realm is investigated and voted on whether it should join the network of Realms bound to the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - This theory is popular because of the presence and power the Gods from the Divine Realm have. <br>
                            - The only flaw is that the Divine Realm itself was bound to the Astral Sea centuries after life on the Astral Sea was observed. <br>
                            <strong>></strong> The Creator <br>
                            - Another popular theory is that the Astral Sea was created by an omnipotent Entity. <br>
                            - That Entity would scour other Universes for Realms which proved entertaining. <br>
                            - The Entity would then pluck that Realm from its native universe and bind it to the Astral Sea's network. <br>
                            - This theory is based on the Aberants, bizzare ruins, and objects found in the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - The majority of translated texts from the ruins or objects reference omnipotent and cosmic entities. <br>
                            - Although no concrete proof of a Creator exists. <br>
                            <strong>></strong> The Stronghold <br>
                            - This theory dictates that the Universe willed the Astral Sea into existence. <br>
                            - The Astral Sea does not confine the Realms to it, but instead gives those Realms a network of other Realms they can communicate with. <br>
                            - These Realms end up in constant contact and raise eachother. <br>
                            - The end goal being to have a series of Realms which would act as a Stronghold against some sort of threat the Universe faces. <br>
                            - This theory is given merit as the Realms bound to it are perfect for moulding and being rebuilt. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>First Life</strong> <br>
                            - The first life to exist on the Astral Sea was Aberrant and it simply came into existence without an evolutionary process milleniums ago. <br>
                            - - It defied the laws of nature, and all logic. <br>
                            - The apex of the first observed life were the Mind Flayers. <br>
                            - - They butchered eachother at first, clawing to be the only living thing. <br>
                            - - This inane slaughter continued for centuries, until more life manifested. <br>
                            - Grimlocks, Berbalang, Gith, Gaj, Otyugh, and Beholders. <br>
                            - The Mind Flayers did not enjoy this company, and carved out small portions of land which they lived on in isolation. <br>
                            - This isolation did not last. Some Mind Flayers became aware that they could read the thoughts of this lesser life, and some even learned to use their psychic abilities to completely control the lesser life. <br>
                            - The Mind Flayers assembled armies of lesser life and micromanaged them to hunt and kill other Mind Flayers. <br>
                            - This bloodshed lasted until very few Mind Flayers remained. <br>
                            - In the vaccum left by the Mind Flayers, the next-best species with intelligence is the Gith, and they formed their own nation. <br>
                            - - The Empire of Shaire <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>First Realm</strong> <br>
                            - The First Realm bound to the Astral Sea is now known as the Divine Realm. <br>
                            - It is a Realm with three planes. An Infernal Hell, a Celestial Heaven, and The City. <br>
                            - When the Realm was initially bound to the Astral Sea the gates of Heaven and Hell literally opened. <br>
                            - Celestials, Demons, and Devils poured into the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - - The lower ranked of their species were slaughtered by the Aberrants. <br>
                            - The Empire of Shaire engaged in its first war, and its longest war. <br>
                            - - A war that continues to the present day. <br>
                            - The Celestials quickly realised that engaging in warfare with The Empire would be a waste of resources, as even the dumbest Aberrants could strategise, organize and massacre celestials with little difficulty. <br>
                            - The Devils fared quite well against the Aberrants, but were the first to avoid war, and formally surrendered to The Empire. <br>
                            - The Demons did not surrender, and engage in battles actively to the present day. <br>
                            - Celestials also engage in battles but with much less frequency than the Demons. <br>
                            - The Gods did not emerge from their Realm until much later in time. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Realm of Beasts</strong> <br>
                            - The Realm of Beasts was discovered by the Emperor.<br>
                            - There was a temple on a small island a long sail from the continent that the Empire was built on.<br>
                            - - This temple had nothing but a portal.<br>
                            - - That portal lead to the Realm of Beasts.<br>
                            - This Realm was given its name based on the fact that one book is simply not enough to store all the beasts which exist in the Realm.<br>
                            - The Realm was marked as off-limits, the risk of was too great for the natural resources.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Kyofu</strong><br>
                            - When the Fourth Realm became bound to the Astral Sea it was suffering a culture war.<br>
                            - - The Dwarves and Gnomes which were natives to Kyofu had lots of tension and conflict over their differences.<br>
                            - - Both the Dwarves and Gnomes despised eachother and were escalating tensions until eventually there would be a Realm-wide War.<br>
                            - When the connection between the Astral Sea and Kyofu was found, the Emperor made two deals for natural resources, and services.<br>
                            - - The Dwarven Empire of Darmour made a deal with the Emperor to provide the Empire of Shaire the creation of weapons, armor, and coinage in the form of Crowns.<br>
                            - - The Gnomish Kingdom of Chensetta made a deal with the Emperor to provide the Empire of Shaire with ships to sail on Endless Sea.<br>
                            - - Both Darmour and Chensetta sent several of their skilled workers to teach the Gith of the Empire of Shaire.<br>
                            <strong>></strong> It was around this point in time where the Gith "evolved" naturally, rather than manifesting.<br>
                            - The Gith had two "evolutions". <br>
                            - - The Githyanki, which are naturally athletic and have sturdy bodies.<br>
                            - - The Githzerai, which are naturally better at interpolating information.<br>
                            - The Emperor had the Githyanki act as labourers, blacksmiths, construction workers, and foot-soldiers in the Shaire's military.<br>
                            - The Emperor had the Githzerai act as the engineers, strategists, diplomats, and government workers.<br>
                            - The Gith's "evolutions" did not age in the Astral Sea.<br>
                            - - They could remain a newborn for... forever.<br>
                            - The Emperor created a system derived from Kyofu<br>
                            - - Specifically a Time management, and Calendar system based on the Gnomish Kingdom Chensetta's systems.<br>
                            - - There were Ten days in a week, Five weeks in a Month, and Eighteen Months in a Year.<br>
                            <strong>></strong> The Emperor used that system to help the Githyanki and Githzerai age.<br>
                            - Newborn children would be taken to Kyofu where they would live in a specialised territory, managed by the Emperor.<br>
                            - The children would live there for four years, they are then taken back to the Astral Sea <br>
                            - - They attend specialised schooling designed to probe their interests and stoke their curiosiity.<br>
                            - - Gith children would spend a maximum of six years in this school program, they are then taken back to Kyofu to age further.<br>
                            - Back on Kyofu, the children attend a different kind of school which is designed to encourage the children to pick between book studies, and physical activity.<br>
                            - - The children attend this school until they reach maturity and become a Githzerai or Githyanki<br>
                            - - This process takes around four years.<br>
                            - Once matured (at a mental age of ~14), the Gith are taken back to the Astral Sea <br>
                            - - They are put back into a schooling system which is designed to find the Gith's specialization (if they have one).<br>
                            - - Whether a Githyanki is capable of becoming a praise-worthy general, or if a Githzerai will hold a high position in the Empire is all identified in this phase.<br>
                            - The Gith will remain in this schooling for a maximum of ten years.<br>
                            - - Afterwards they are provided with a job, specialization, and home.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Fifth Realm</strong> <br>
                            - When Aerialis became bound to the Astral Sea, things were different.<br>
                            - Aerialis was simply refered to as the Fifth Realm, the Realm was made up of floating islands, storms, and air currents.<br>
                            - It was devoid of life and the Emperor did not see a point in exploring it.<br>
                            - After a few decades of nothing special occuring, a few Gods were spotted in the Astral Sea, specifically the Goddess Sonyia and the God Lerranmoraxitro.<br>
                            - Three centuries later marks the beginning of the Dragon Epidemic.<br>
                            - - Lerranmoraxitro who created all sorts of life on Aerialis and had them living in harmony decided to grant His created life freedom.<br>
                            - Aerialis imploded, with the Dragons believing that they were superior to everything which was mortal.<br>
                            - The Dragons eventually found Aerialis too small, and invaded the Astral Sea.<br>
                            - But, declaring war against the Empire of Shaire was a miscalculation.<br>
                            - - It took no less than three decades for the Chromatic Dragons to be rendered extinct.<br>
                            - - They were considered the pinnacle of Dragons, with some being comparable to the younger Gods of the time.<br>
                            - - When on the battlefield against the Empire of Shaire these Dragons were no more than larger lizards.<br>
                            - Some Dragons learned that the Astral Sea had other Realms connected to it, and used that network to travel to Kyofu and the Realm of Beasts.<br>
                            - - Kyofu entered an era known presently as the "Lost Dragon War", not because it is lost to time, but because Kyofu lost. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Feywild</strong> <br>
                            - When the Feywild was bound to the Astral Sea it was after the Dragon Epidemic, but before Kyofu's Dragon War ended. <br>
                            - The Feywild had no High-Elves when it was initially bound to the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - The Emperor of Shaire was given permission to use a small portion of the Feywild to construct facilities which would be used for the Gith aging system. <br>
                            - The Emperor also spent a lot of time learning Magic from the Elves. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Felled Realm</strong> <br>
                            - It is unknown what the Felled Realm was like when it was bound to the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - It has been felled for milleniums. <br>
                            - Only a few of the present day Elder Gods, and a few Immortals from the Astral Sea are old enough to know about the Felled Realm's History. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Endless City</strong> <br>
                            - When the Endless City became bound to the Astral Sea many things had changed. <br>
                            - The Emperor was no longer a public figure. <br>
                            - The Empire had become more industrious and directly influenced the Elven evolution of High-Elves, and more, the construction of Laeto. <br>
                            - Those in the Astral Sea do not get abducted by the Endless City. <br>
                            - The City-State of Neo-Neprad had appeared on the Edge of the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - - In present day, it is closer to the center than the edge. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Jotunheim</strong> <br>
                            - When the Realm of Jotunheim became bound to the Astral Sea the Dwarves and Gnomes cheered. <br>
                            - A Realm made up of Mountains with densely packed resources. <br>
                            - The Astral Sea saw a new kind of traveler from the Realms. <br>
                            - - The insane glory seeker. <br>
                            - Goliaths were born to hunt and have a strong emphasis on honour. <br>
                            - - Upon hearing about the Aberrant creatures in the Astral Sea, Goliaths started traveling to hunt these creatures. <br>
                            - - This inspired other races from acrross the Realms to sail the Astral Sea. <br>

                            - By the time Garna was bound to the Astral Sea, many things had changed. <br>
                            - The Empire of Shaire was no longer an absolute force. <br>
                            - The Various Pirate Factions (VPF) united as one faction and acted as a rebellion against the Empire. <br>
                            - Wild Gods began appearing around the Realms, and traveling to the Astral Sea to experience it, only to die or join hands with the Empire. <br>

                            - The VPF has grown into a massive organization. <br>
                            - They are loosely structured but are severely impacting the Empire. <br>
                            - The Emperor formed a new branch to the Empire of Shaire's military. <br>
                            - - The Inquisition. <br>
                            - Many mortals close to attaining Godhood end up killed by the Natural God, Godwyn. <br>
                            - A young Wild God named Xornoren, managed to avoid Godwyn and upon reaching the status of a God, changed the weather paterns in every realm to include a harsher winter. <br>

                            <strong>Environment</strong> <br>
                            - A savage realm of primeval forests, deserts of crimson sand, jagged mountain ranges, and acidic seas.<br>
                            - The air is thick, hot, and laced with spores, ash, and toxins. <br>
                            - - Storms rage without warning, floods of blood-colored rain carving valleys in moments.<br>
                            - Life is oversized, hyper-aggressive, and predatory. <br>
                            - - Even prey animals kill with horns, claws, or venom. <br>
                            - - Most plants are carnivorous or toxic, strangling one another in endless competition.<br>
                            - Safe shelter, drinkable water, and edible food are treasures rarer than gold, and entire tribes fight over a single oasis or a half-day’s refuge in a Titan’s shadow.<br>
                            - The ground shifts with migrating beasts or Titan tremors, and survival outside Soniya’s stronghold is a lottery.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Sonyia and the Stronghold</strong> <br>
                            - Sonyia rules from an impregnable stronghold layered within the "Third Realm".<br>
                            - Her stronghold houses a pristine and orderly society, contrasting the chaos outside. <br>
                            - - Towering arenas, academies of combat and lore, sprawling markets, artisan guilds, and vast barracks fill its walls.<br>
                            - - The most popular attraction is the Museum of Heroes, where victors of the tournaments are immortalized in paintings, preserved heads, or full taxidermy.<br>
                            - Society within the stronghold reveres strength, courage, knowledge, and creativity. <br>
                            - - Poets are honored the same as warriors, strategists with dragon-slayers, inventors with gladiators.<br>
                            - Soniya is seen as an eccentric, benevolent tyrant. <br>
                            - - Her rule is absolute, Her will is enforced with an iron fist, and the strongest of knights. <br>
                            - - Any crime, no matter the scale, is punishable by forced entry into the tournaments.<br>
                            <strong>></strong> Survival or Victory in any of Sonyia's tournaments means a pardon. <br>
                            - - Living through Her Games means to be reborn free, to have your soul cleansed of all debts and sins. <br>
                            - - Some criminals wish to be caught, believing the Tournaments are a faster road to freedom than years of punishment and poverty. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Death Games</strong> <br>
                            - The Games are brutal, controlled chaos. <br>
                            - - Arenas range from flooded caverns filled with amphibious predators to mirrored labyrinths where combatants face both monsters and their own reflections.<br>
                            - - No tournament is the same as the previous. <br>
                            - Volunteers enter for glory, spectacle, or the faint hope of being remembered forever in the Museum of Heroes.<br>
                            - Criminals, deserters, and captured enemies are drafted unwillingly. <br>
                            - - They are thrown into the Games as fodder or obstacles for greater challengers.<br>
                            - The Games are not for wealth. Soniya offers only honor and immortality of name. <br>
                            - - No crowns, no artifact, no divine blessings; only remembrance and spectacle.<br>
                            - Gambling empires thrive on the outcomes. Fortunes rise and collapse with every kill. <br>
                            - - Entire wars have been funded or lost based on wagers placed on the Games.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Titans</strong> <br>
                            - Over thirty Titans prowl the realm, each a walking apocalypse. <br>
                            - - Their territories warp ecosystems into extremes of heat, cold, poison, or elemental fury.<br>
                            - Trespass is instant death. A Titan shifting its hunting grounds means extinction for entire regions. <br>
                            - - Their spawn and symbiotes dominate the food chain beneath them.<br>
                            - They are the environment. They are the storms, plagues, and cataclysms of the Realm of Beasts.<br>
                            - Even Gods avoid this land. Only Soniya’s stronghold remains untouched, as if her presence alone intimidates the Titans.<br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Environment</strong> <br>
                            - The Felled Realm is half-dead, and locked in perpetual dimness, its skies bruised purple and black with endless storms, pollution, and dense clouds.<br>
                            - The air stinks of smoke, rot, and disease. <br>
                            - Any illness can become fatal in days. <br>
                            - The ground seems exhausted, robbed of its fertility after centuries of decay.<br>
                            - Small pockets of stubborn life remain. <br>
                            - - Mold that glows faintly in the dark. <br>
                            - - Insects that feed on corrupted waste. <br>
                            - - Crops of blackened fungus barely edible to survivors.<br>
                            - At the heart of the Realm’s resistance is Darmour, a ruined town with a single tree untouched by the corruption. <br>
                            - - Its fruits are luminous, nourishing, and miraculous. <br>
                            - - Just one a day is enough to sustain a person for an entire day. <br>
                            - - The tree is a living beacon of defiance, and both Oterum and Octo understand its value. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Oterum’s Senselss Destruction</strong> <br>
                            - Oterum seems to desire nothing but utter ruin. <br>
                            <strong>></strong> His influence seeps through every stone, whispering into the minds of mortals, driving them mad.<br>
                            - His followers are zealots, their humanity broken into madness. <br>
                            - - They carve themselves in rituals of loyalty, chant endlessly to the dark, and worship undeath as a holy gift.<br>
                            - The undead wander ruins, are heaped in temples, or are bound to labour as endless, undying slaves. <br>
                            - - They are slow, but countless and tireless.<br>
                            - Demons and Fiends flock to Oterum’s rot, acting as his enforcers and butchers. <br>
                            - - They hunt survivors for sport, guard cult leaders, organize, and supply the various cults which worship Oterum.<br>
                            - Liches loyal to Oterum rule like governors. <br>
                            - - They lead these cults, oversee, and expand Oterum's grasp. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Octo’s Rebellion</strong> <br>
                            - Octo is a lich, who never bowed to Oterum, or any of the Gods. <br>
                            - - Ancient, brilliant, and driven, Octo seeks to destroy Oterum and the cults which serve Him.<br>
                            - Octo’s forces are undead bent to his will, and the few rebels who still resist. <br>
                            - He sabotages rituals, steals Oterum’s tribute, and undermines Oterum's undead networks. <br>
                            - His agents do their best to convince survivors that restoration is possible, that the Realm can live again.<br>
                            - Octo is not benevolent. <br>
                            - - He is pragmatic, cold, ruthless, and realistic. <br>
                            - - His dream is restoration, but his methods are often as cruel as Oterum’s. <br>
                            - - Survivors aid him because his goals align with their survival, not because they trust him.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Survivors</strong> <br>
                            - Scattered pockets of mortals, known as the Doomed to the Realms outside the Seventh, cling to the little hope they have. <br> 
                            - - They form small communities in forgotten ruins, sewers, caves, and anywhere they can make safe for even a night. <br>
                            - - The largest population of survivors is the town of Darmour.<br>
                            - They scavenge for food and clean water, often surviving on fungus, insects, or a single bite of Darmour’s fruit shared among many.<br>
                            - Trust is close to non-existant. <br> 
                            - Alliances are short-lived. <br>
                            - Betrayal is common, sometimes for food, sometimes for mercy at the hands of Oterum’s cults.<br>
                            - Despite the horrors, many cling to Octo’s vision. <br>
                            - - Some dream of reclaiming the realm. <br>
                            - - Some fight only for the chance their children might live better. <br>
                            - - Their existence proves that the Realm is not wholly dead—it can resist.<br>

                            <strong>Environment</strong> <br>
                            - Jotunheim is a vast, unforgiving highland of jagged peaks, glacier-carved valleys, and sheer cliffs of dark granite and slate.<br>
                            - The air is thin and biting, with sudden blizzards and avalanches shaping life at every elevation. <br>
                            - Breath frosts in seconds, and flat ground is scarce.<br>
                            - Life always finds a way. <br>
                            - - Hardy tundra grasses, lichen, and low shrubs cling to the slopes and caves. <br>
                            - - Mountain herds roam the valleys. <br>
                            - - Geothermal vents and rare mineral seams promise wealth to those who can reach them.<br>
                            - Settlements nestle in protected valleys, cling to mountainsides, or burrow deep beneath the permafrost. <br>
                            - Survival demands ingenuity, community, and courage; being alone in Jotunheim is a death sentence.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Binding</strong> <br>
                            - When Jotunheim became bound to the Astral Sea, the Dwarves and Gnomes flocked to it. <br>
                            - Kyofu was a wasteland, the freezing temperatures and jagged mountains seemed like paradise.  <br>
                            - The Dwarves and Gnomes split themselves into different groups, forming new kingdoms. <br>
                            - The first few years were prosperous, these new kingdoms would trade well with the Empire. <br>
                            - But, like with the history of most Realms, nothing good lasts forever.

                            <strong>The Goliaths</strong> <br>
                            - The first settled kingdoms formed, expanded, and began trade with one another. <br>
                            - During one of the first convoys for the trading of goods. <br>
                            - The kingdom of Darmour and kingdom of Gniegn worked together to find a proper trade route. <br>
                            - Along their route they saw a fairly large group of towering figures. <br> 
                            - - Named "Goliaths" after their size. <br>
                            - - They are a nomadic species that travels with heards of livestock. <br>
                            - - They do not set up shelter or light fires. <br>
                            - - They wander the icy landscape free from everything. <br>
                            - During the first few decades Goliaths and the kingdoms opposed eachother. <br>
                            - Goliaths raided trade convoys for resources. <br>
                            - The kingdoms forced restrictions to which land was safe for Goliaths. <br>
                            - This animocity persists until the present day. <br>
                            - With Goliaths and the Jotunheim kingdoms being at odds with one another. <br>
                        </p>

                            <strong>The Mountain Alliance's Founding</strong> <br>
                            - The skirmishes with Goliaths were taxing on the kingdoms forces. <br>
                            - The kingdoms stayed the course until one trade convoy vanished. <br>
                            - Only wreckage remained. <br>
                            - After scouts were sent and the area was thoroughly investigated. <br>
                            - - A major discovery was found. <br>
                            - - The first Giant. Not the first Giant to be born, but the first Giant witnessed by the kingdoms. <br>
                            - This Giant was tracked by Darmour's forces, and killed. <br>
                            - It wasn't long afterwards that one of the kingdoms ended up destroyed. <br>
                            - - The survivors say that a group of Giants razed the kingdom. <br>
                            - - Several kingdoms were also laid waste to. <br>
                            - This prompted Darmour to create The Mountain Alliance. <br>
                            - - It would be an alliance made up of the heavily fortified Mountain kingdoms. <br>
                            - - Kingdoms which would be able to withstand a lengthy siege against Giants. <br>
                            - - The alliance would track the movements of Giants, identify patterns, <br>
                            - - - and find methods of maintaining survivability inside the mountain strongholds. <br>
                            - The alliance proved successful for Darmour, and a few other mountain-based kingdoms. <br>
                            - Kingdoms continued to fall, trade routes were comprimized, people were slaughtered. <br>
                            - Darmour expanded its territory to occupy a mountain range, and tried to do more to help. <br>
                            - - Taking on even one Giant was incredibly challenging. <br>
                            - - As more kingdoms fell, Darmour had to find more allies to solidify their survival. <br>
                            - - But the kingdoms kept falling, being razed and sieged by the Giants. <br>
                            - Until only one remained. Darmour. <br>

                            <strong>The Giant Extinction Project</strong> <br>
                            - The king of Darmour realized that the kingdom was completely isolated. <br>
                            - Under such desperate conditions, the king decreed a mass militarization order. <br>
                            - - A war was not declared, instead, an order for an extinction of Giants took place. <br>
                            - - The Dwarves and Gnomes worked hand-in-hand to create the Warforged. <br>
                            - - Warforged became capable of reasoning and displayed solid combat skills. <br>
                            - - Darmour's military mobilized. <br>
                            - Giants began falling. <br>
                            - Darmour's military proved incredibly capable when tracking and slaying the Giants. <br>
                            - But, Darmour's resources and manpower were not limitless. <br>
                            - The Goliaths who lived under the threat of Giants, joined the Extinction Project. <br>
                            - - Assisting Darmour's scouting and combat forces. <br>
                            - The two unlikely groups joined together to rid the Realm of Giants. <br>
                            - The Giants were losing, and in a fit of desperation, they awoke the ancients. <br>

                            <strong>The Titans and Gods of Jotunheim</strong> <br>
                            - The Giants awoke the Six Titans who remained in a state of sleep for centuries. <br>
                            - These Titans would destroy mountains, and change the weather patterns and climate. <br>
                            - They killed Giants, Goliaths, livestock, Dwarves, Gnomes, and Warforged. <br>
                            - Darmour realized they needed a force capable of dealing with a Titan, or slow it down. <br>

                            - - The Colossus. <br>
                            - It is an incredible construct which proved to be a useful weapon when dealing with the Titans. <br>
                            - Although, the Colossus was not capable of injuring the Titans in any meaningful way. <br>
                            - - It proved useful when slowing down a Titan's rampage. <br>
                            - The Colossus project struggled to properly deal with the Titan threat. <br>
                            - As if to answer the prayers of the Goliaths, a miracle occured. <br>
                            - - On rare occasions Goliaths with incredible abilities would awaken. <br>
                            - - These Goliaths would gain supernatural abilities suited for combat and survival. <br>
                            - The most notable Goliaths were worshipped as Gods by the nomadic tribes. <br>
                            - - Freyja: A Goliath who fought a Titan to a draw. She is called the "Goddess of Fertility" and has mothered dozens of children. <br>
