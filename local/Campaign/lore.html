                        <p>
                            <strong>Environment</strong> <br>
                            - An infinitely expanding purple ocean.<br>
                            - A sky devoid of sun and stars.<br>
                            - Some of the only light present on the Astral Sea is bioluminescence from algea, and animals.<br>
                            - The remainder is the golden lightning strikes which occur in the clouds, and artificially created light.<br>
                            - The creatures native to the Sea defy logic, and those who call the Sea a home, defy logic as well.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Creation</strong> <br>
                            - The Astral Sea is a Realm which expands infinitely in all directions. <br>
                            - It exists outside space, time, and logic. <br>
                            - It "pulls" Realms from beyond it and confines them to exist within the network of Realms connected to it. <br>
                            - - Each Realm exists as an appendage of the Astral Sea. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Theories</strong> <br>
                            - There are many creation theories behind the Astral Sea.  <br>
                            - It is a topic that has been studided and explored in exhaustive detail by scholars from all the Realms. <br>
                            - The most poular theories involve the idea of near-omnipotent creators. <br>
                            - These theories are popular and have some merit because all the Realms which connect to the Astral Sea have initial similarities. <br>
                            - - The knowledge, science, and magic is all in a state far below that of the other Realms.  <br>
                            - - The Realm is usually in a state of damage, either post-war, or post-natural-disaster. <br>
                            <strong>></strong> Blessing of the Gods <br>
                            - The most popular theory is the theory that the Gods of the Divine Realm created the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - The Gods scour outside the unvierse in search of Realms which require help, and are willing to accept the grace of the Gods. <br>
                            - The Realm is investigated and voted on whether it should join the network of Realms bound to the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - This theory is popular because of the presence and power the Gods from the Divine Realm have. <br>
                            - The only flaw is that the Divine Realm itself was bound to the Astral Sea centuries after life on the Astral Sea was observed. <br>
                            <strong>></strong> The Creator <br>
                            - Another popular theory is that the Astral Sea was created by an omnipotent Entity. <br>
                            - That Entity would scour other Universes for Realms which proved entertaining. <br>
                            - The Entity would then pluck that Realm from its native universe and bind it to the Astral Sea's network. <br>
                            - This theory is based on the Aberants, bizzare ruins, and objects found in the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - The majority of translated texts from the ruins or objects reference omnipotent and cosmic entities. <br>
                            - Although no concrete proof of a Creator exists. <br>
                            <strong>></strong> The Stronghold <br>
                            - This theory dictates that the Universe willed the Astral Sea into existence. <br>
                            - The Astral Sea does not confine the Realms to it, but instead gives those Realms a network of other Realms they can communicate with. <br>
                            - These Realms end up in constant contact and raise eachother. <br>
                            - The end goal being to have a series of Realms which would act as a Stronghold against some sort of threat the Universe faces. <br>
                            - This theory is given merit as the Realms bound to it are perfect for moulding and being rebuilt. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>First Life</strong> <br>
                            - The first life to exist on the Astral Sea was Aberrant and it simply came into existence without an evolutionary process milleniums ago. <br>
                            - - It defied the laws of nature, and all logic. <br>
                            - The apex of the first observed life were the Mind Flayers. <br>
                            - - They butchered eachother at first, clawing to be the only living thing. <br>
                            - - This inane slaughter continued for centuries, until more life manifested. <br>
                            - Grimlocks, Berbalang, Gith, Gaj, Otyugh, and Beholders. <br>
                            - The Mind Flayers did not enjoy this company, and carved out small portions of land which they lived on in isolation. <br>
                            - This isolation did not last. Some Mind Flayers became aware that they could read the thoughts of this lesser life, and some even learned to use their psychic abilities to completely control the lesser life. <br>
                            - The Mind Flayers assembled armies of lesser life and micromanaged them to hunt and kill other Mind Flayers. <br>
                            - This bloodshed lasted until very few Mind Flayers remained. <br>
                            - In the vaccum left by the Mind Flayers, the next-best species with intelligence is the Gith, and they formed their own nation. <br>
                            - - The Empire of Shaire <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>First Realm</strong> <br>
                            - The First Realm bound to the Astral Sea is now known as the Divine Realm. <br>
                            - It is a Realm with three planes. An Infernal Hell, a Celestial Heaven, and The City. <br>
                            - When the Realm was initially bound to the Astral Sea the gates of Heaven and Hell literally opened. <br>
                            - Celestials, Demons, and Devils poured into the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - - The lower ranked of their species were slaughtered by the Aberrants. <br>
                            - The Empire of Shaire engaged in its first war, and its longest war. <br>
                            - - A war that continues to the present day. <br>
                            - The Celestials quickly realised that engaging in warfare with The Empire would be a waste of resources, as even the dumbest Aberrants could strategise, organize and massacre celestials with little difficulty. <br>
                            - The Devils fared quite well against the Aberrants, but were the first to avoid war, and formally surrendered to The Empire. <br>
                            - The Demons did not surrender, and engage in battles actively to the present day. <br>
                            - Celestials also engage in battles but with much less frequency than the Demons. <br>
                            - The Gods did not emerge from their Realm until much later in time. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Realm of Beasts</strong> <br>
                            - The Realm of Beasts was discovered by the Emperor.<br>
                            - There was a temple on a small island a long sail from the continent that the Empire was built on.<br>
                            - - This temple had nothing but a portal.<br>
                            - - That portal lead to the Realm of Beasts.<br>
                            - This Realm was given its name based on the fact that one book is simply not enough to store all the beasts which exist in the Realm.<br>
                            - The Realm was marked as off-limits, the risk of was too great for the natural resources.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Kyofu</strong><br>
                            - When the Fourth Realm became bound to the Astral Sea it was suffering a culture war.<br>
                            - - The Dwarves and Gnomes which were natives to Kyofu had lots of tension and conflict over their differences.<br>
                            - - Both the Dwarves and Gnomes despised eachother and were escalating tensions until eventually there would be a Realm-wide War.<br>
                            - When the connection between the Astral Sea and Kyofu was found, the Emperor made two deals for natural resources, and services.<br>
                            - - The Dwarven Empire of Darmour made a deal with the Emperor to provide the Empire of Shaire the creation of weapons, armor, and coinage in the form of Crowns.<br>
                            - - The Gnomish Kingdom of Chensetta made a deal with the Emperor to provide the Empire of Shaire with ships to sail on Endless Sea.<br>
                            - - Both Darmour and Chensetta sent several of their skilled workers to teach the Gith of the Empire of Shaire.<br>
                            <strong>></strong> It was around this point in time where the Gith "evolved" naturally, rather than manifesting.<br>
                            - The Gith had two "evolutions". <br>
                            - - The Githyanki, which are naturally athletic and have sturdy bodies.<br>
                            - - The Githzerai, which are naturally better at interpolating information.<br>
                            - The Emperor had the Githyanki act as labourers, blacksmiths, construction workers, and foot-soldiers in the Shaire's military.<br>
                            - The Emperor had the Githzerai act as the engineers, strategists, diplomats, and government workers.<br>
                            - The Gith's "evolutions" did not age in the Astral Sea.<br>
                            - - They could remain a newborn for... forever.<br>
                            - The Emperor created a system derived from Kyofu<br>
                            - - Specifically a Time management, and Calendar system based on the Gnomish Kingdom Chensetta's systems.<br>
                            - - There were Ten days in a week, Five weeks in a Month, and Eighteen Months in a Year.<br>
                            <strong>></strong> The Emperor used that system to help the Githyanki and Githzerai age.<br>
                            - Newborn children would be taken to Kyofu where they would live in a specialised territory, managed by the Emperor.<br>
                            - The children would live there for four years, they are then taken back to the Astral Sea <br>
                            - - They attend specialised schooling designed to probe their interests and stoke their curiosiity.<br>
                            - - Gith children would spend a maximum of six years in this school program, they are then taken back to Kyofu to age further.<br>
                            - Back on Kyofu, the children attend a different kind of school which is designed to encourage the children to pick between book studies, and physical activity.<br>
                            - - The children attend this school until they reach maturity and become a Githzerai or Githyanki<br>
                            - - This process takes around four years.<br>
                            - Once matured (at a mental age of ~14), the Gith are taken back to the Astral Sea <br>
                            - - They are put back into a schooling system which is designed to find the Gith's specialization (if they have one).<br>
                            - - Whether a Githyanki is capable of becoming a praise-worthy general, or if a Githzerai will hold a high position in the Empire is all identified in this phase.<br>
                            - The Gith will remain in this schooling for a maximum of ten years.<br>
                            - - Afterwards they are provided with a job, specialization, and home.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Fifth Realm</strong> <br>
                            - When Aerialis became bound to the Astral Sea, things were different.<br>
                            - Aerialis was simply refered to as the Fifth Realm, the Realm was made up of floating islands, storms, and air currents.<br>
                            - It was devoid of life and the Emperor did not see a point in exploring it.<br>
                            - After a few decades of nothing special occuring, a few Gods were spotted in the Astral Sea, specifically the Goddess Sonyia and the God Lerranmoraxitro.<br>
                            - Three centuries later marks the beginning of the Dragon Epidemic.<br>
                            - - Lerranmoraxitro who created all sorts of life on Aerialis and had them living in harmony decided to grant His created life freedom.<br>
                            - Aerialis imploded, with the Dragons believing that they were superior to everything which was mortal.<br>
                            - The Dragons eventually found Aerialis too small, and invaded the Astral Sea.<br>
                            - But, declaring war against the Empire of Shaire was a miscalculation.<br>
                            - - It took no less than three decades for the Chromatic Dragons to be rendered extinct.<br>
                            - - They were considered the pinnacle of Dragons, with some being comparable to the younger Gods of the time.<br>
                            - - When on the battlefield against the Empire of Shaire these Dragons were no more than larger lizards.<br>
                            - Some Dragons learned that the Astral Sea had other Realms connected to it, and used that network to travel to Kyofu and the Realm of Beasts.<br>
                            - - Kyofu entered an era known presently as the "Lost Dragon War", not because it is lost to time, but because Kyofu lost. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Feywild</strong> <br>
                            - When the Feywild was bound to the Astral Sea it was after the Dragon Epidemic, but before Kyofu's Dragon War ended. <br>
                            - The Feywild had no High-Elves when it was initially bound to the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - The Emperor of Shaire was given permission to use a small portion of the Feywild to construct facilities which would be used for the Gith aging system. <br>
                            - The Emperor also spent a lot of time learning Magic from the Elves. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Felled Realm</strong> <br>
                            - It is unknown what the Felled Realm was like when it was bound to the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - It has been felled for milleniums. <br>
                            - Only a few of the present day Elder Gods, and a few Immortals from the Astral Sea are old enough to know about the Felled Realm's History. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Endless City</strong> <br>
                            - When the Endless City became bound to the Astral Sea many things had changed. <br>
                            - The Emperor was no longer a public figure. <br>
                            - The Empire had become more industrious and directly influenced the Elven evolution of High-Elves, and more, the construction of Laeto. <br>
                            - Those in the Astral Sea do not get abducted by the Endless City. <br>
                            - The City-State of Neo-Neprad had appeared on the Edge of the Astral Sea. <br>
                            - - In present day, it is closer to the center than the edge. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Jotunheim</strong> <br>
                            - When the Realm of Jotunheim became bound to the Astral Sea the Dwarves and Gnomes cheered. <br>
                            - A Realm made up of Mountains with densely packed resources. <br>
                            - The Astral Sea saw a new kind of traveler from the Realms. <br>
                            - - The insane glory seeker. <br>
                            - Goliaths were born to hunt and have a strong emphasis on honour. <br>
                            - - Upon hearing about the Aberrant creatures in the Astral Sea, Goliaths started traveling to hunt these creatures. <br>
                            - - This inspired other races from acrross the Realms to sail the Astral Sea. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Garna</strong> <br>
                            - By the time Garna was bound to the Astral Sea, many things had changed. <br>
                            - The Empire of Shaire was no longer an absolute force. <br>
                            - The Various Pirate Factions (VPF) united as one faction and acted as a rebellion against the Empire. <br>
                            - Wild Gods began appearing around the Realms, and traveling to the Astral Sea to experience it, only to die or join hands with the Empire. <br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Present Day</strong> <br>
                            - The VPF has grown into a massive organization. <br>
                            - They are loosely structured but are severely impacting the Empire. <br>
                            - The Emperor formed a new branch to the Empire of Shaire's military. <br>
                            - - The Inquisition. <br>
                            - Many mortals close to attaining Godhood end up killed by the Natural God, Godwyn. <br>
                            - A young Wild God named Xornoren, managed to avoid Godwyn and upon reaching the status of a God, changed the weather paterns in every realm to include a harsher winter. <br>
                            - - Four months of Spring, Four months of Summer, Four months of fall, and Six months of a harsh and brutal winter. <br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Environment</strong> <br>
                            - A savage realm of primeval forests, deserts of crimson sand, jagged mountain ranges, and acidic seas.<br>
                            - The air is thick, hot, and laced with spores, ash, and toxins. <br>
                            - - Storms rage without warning, floods of blood-colored rain carving valleys in moments.<br>
                            - Life is oversized, hyper-aggressive, and predatory. <br>
                            - - Even prey animals kill with horns, claws, or venom. <br>
                            - - Most plants are carnivorous or toxic, strangling one another in endless competition.<br>
                            - Safe shelter, drinkable water, and edible food are treasures rarer than gold, and entire tribes fight over a single oasis or a half-day’s refuge in a Titan’s shadow.<br>
                            - The ground shifts with migrating beasts or Titan tremors, and survival outside Soniya’s stronghold is a lottery.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Soniya and the Stronghold</strong> <br>
                            - Soniya rules from an impregnable stronghold layered within the "Third Realm".<br>
                            - Her stronghold houses a pristine and orderly society, contrasting the chaos outside. <br>
                            - - The walls hold the Museum of Heroes, where victors of the tournaments are immortalized in paintings, preserved heads, or full taxidermy.<br>
                            - The stronghold projects Soniya’s will across the multiverse. <br>
                            - - Taverns, palaces, war camps, even divine halls display her broadcasts, ensuring all will witness her grim spectacles.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Death Games</strong> <br>
                            - The Games are brutal, controlled chaos. <br>
                            - - Arenas range from flooded caverns filled with amphibious predators to mirrored labyrinths where combatants face both monsters and their own reflections.<br>
                            - - No tournament is the same as the previous. <br>
                            - Volunteers enter for glory, spectacle, or the faint hope of being remembered forever in the Museum of Heroes.<br>
                            - Criminals, deserters, and captured enemies are drafted unwillingly. <br>
                            - - They are thrown into the Games as fodder or obstacles for greater challengers.<br>
                            - The Games are not for wealth. Soniya offers only honor and immortality of name. <br>
                            - - No crowns, no artifact, no divine blessings; only remembrance and spectacle.<br>
                            - Gambling empires thrive on the outcomes. Fortunes rise and collapse with every kill. <br>
                            - - Entire wars have been funded or lost based on wagers placed on the Games.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Titans</strong> <br>
                            - Over thirty Titans prowl the realm, each a walking apocalypse. <br>
                            - - Their territories warp ecosystems into extremes of heat, cold, poison, or elemental fury.<br>
                            - Trespass is instant death. A Titan shifting its hunting grounds means extinction for entire regions. <br>
                            - - Their spawn and symbiotes dominate the food chain beneath them.<br>
                            - They are the environment. They are the storms, plagues, and cataclysms of the Realm of Beasts.<br>
                            - Even Gods avoid this land. Only Soniya’s stronghold remains untouched, as if her presence alone intimidates the Titans.<br>
