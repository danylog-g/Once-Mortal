                <strong>The Realm</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The planetary surface is a magically and physically ruined hellscape. 
                Think jagged, irradiated rock, acidic seas, perpetual ash storms, unstable magic zones, 
                and bizarre, mutated remnants of past life. It's incredibly resource-rich. 
                There are veins of sky-iron, potent elemental crystals, rare magical isotopes, 
                and salvageable ancient tech litter the ruins. 
                But the environment is instantly lethal to most organic life without extreme protection. 
                Exposure means rapid death.

                <strong>Above the Clouds</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Civilization exists in massive, 
                fortified airships and sprawling sky-docks anchored to stable atmospheric layers or floating mountains. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Dwarves are master engineers and smiths. Operate the largest, 
                most heavily armored industrial airships and refinery platforms. 
                Focus on extracting and processing surface resources using shielded drills, 
                remote drones, and hazardous salvage teams. Gritty, practical, 
                and fiercely protective of their ships and claims. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Gnomes are brilliant innovators and tinkerers. Run lighter, 
                faster scout ships, research vessels, and intricate salvage rigs. 
                Focus on retrieving ancient tech, mapping unstable magic zones (remotely), 
                and developing new gadgets to survive Kyofu. 
                Often work alongside or contract with Dwarven industrial ops. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Warforged are vital for the most hazardous tasks. Serve as pilots for small salvage skiffs, 
                heavy labor on mining platforms, security, and as the primary workforce in environments too toxic for flesh. 
                Many operate semi-independently. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Invaders from other realms (like Aerialis or Material Plane factions). 
                Fly fast, armed skiffs and repurposed warships. Ambush mining convoys, 
                raid sky-docks for supplies/fuel/tech, and attempt risky surface grabs for high-value resources. 
                Ruthless and opportunistic. <br>

                <strong>Below Ground</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Bunker communities are made up those who fled the surface destruction or sought autonomy. 
                Form communities in the deepest, most stable bunkers. Maintain life-support systems, 
                mine geothermal energy, and conduct long-term salvage ops deeper underground. 
                Often wary of surface-dwellers and pirates. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Pirates who are active on the surface, 
                are no better than ruthless gangs who have seized control of bunker complexes. 
                Use them as hidden bases to launch surface raids or 
                ambush sky-miners accessing underground resources (geothermal vents, deep mineral seams). 
                Live in relative (but harsh) safety compared to the sky, 
                exploiting bunker systems and enslaved labor (often captured Warforged or other pirates). <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The real struggle. Breathable air, clean water, stable fuel (magical or chemical), 
                food (grown in precarious sky-gardens or vat labs), 
                and replacement parts for airships/bunkers are constant concerns. 
                The surface offers immense mineral wealth, 
                but acquiring it consumes vital resources and lives. <br>

                <strong>The Council</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; "The Fort". A colossal, ancient castle rising from relatively stable mountains.
                It's heavily shielded and surrounded by a fortified sky-dock city and deep subterranean roots. 
                Access is heavily controlled. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Council began as a necessary alliance for defense against Godwyn and has since turned into 
                a powerful, secretive bureaucratic and quasi-military organization. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; To the desperate populations of Kyofu, The Council isn't just government; 
                they are the sole guarantors of survival. Obedience and loyalty to The Council are paramount virtues preached by its propagandists. 
                Its leaders are seen as infallible architects of order in chaos. 
                Rituals involve oath-swearing, veneration of The Fort, and ceremonies for resource allocation. 
                This encroachment on divine domains (law, order, survival, community), and their overall power is what angers the Gods. <br>
