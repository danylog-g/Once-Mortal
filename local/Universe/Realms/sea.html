                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; A country based on a “democratic” system, where the leaders of the nation are elected by the people. 
                They are a fairly minor city-state nation which spans several islands on the Sea. 
                Their magical capability and skill is not very advanced, but their technology is centuries ahead of the current Realms.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;  It is a country that is struggling to maintain its own functionality with the seemingly endless anarchic chaos of the Astral Sea surrounding it. 
                They have achieved order in their own little corner of the Sea. 
                Through the trust of the people and their superior technology they are able to defend themselves from the tirade of Pirates, the Empire, and the Storms.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;  The citizens of Neo-Neprad are strictly indoctrinated as capable soldiers and educated people capable of being functioning members of their society. 
                From farming, fishing, engineering, and combat. 
                A functioning citizen would know the basics of all those topics, both practical and theoretical knowledge. 
                Surrounded by all sorts of horrors which the Astral Sea contains causes most of the citizens to turn towards isolationist philosophies and paranoid tendencies. 
                Every stranger could be a spy, even the shadows could contain threats. 
                They strive to protect their stability while the Endless Sea ceaselessly rages outside.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;  Individuality is secondary to communal survival. 
                Neo-Neprad incentivises and glorifies military and government service; 
                dissent and seeds of rebellion are systematically destroyed and turned to ash.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;  Neo-Neprad has a systematic defense with layered walls, reinforced bridges, monolithic defense and watch towers. 
                Small metal birds [drones] which patrol the state systematically and in groups.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;  The city-state’s territory is split between several islands which are very close together. 
                There are islands populated with government workers, wind turbines, temples, food-forests, markets, workshops, and harbors.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <Strong>Government</Strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The government of Neo-Neprad is a hybrid of Theocratic Democracy.
                It is designed to create and ensure a degree of stability in the midst of existential crisis, or total collapse.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Neo-Neprad has a 70 seat senate.
                It is created to balance the three powers within Neo-Neprad: Meritocratic Order, Divine Order, and Collective Rule.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The ruler of Neo-Neprad is a Wild God, from the Feywild, named Sylvar Neprad.
                She is the constitutional "Guiding Light". A non-voting entity who has incredible authority.
                Sylvar can halt Tier 1 legislation (rationing policy), or mandate Tier 3 decisions (preemptive strikes).
                Sylvar has the final say on arbitrations, or any ties which happen within the senate. 
                People Sylvar proposes to have a seat at the senate must be approved with a citizen vote.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; 42 of the Senate's seats are populated by senators elected by the people. These are called "The Voices".
                The other 28 seats are made up of specialists selected by Sylvar. These are called "Lanterns".
                The two opposite sides clash frequently.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Voices always focus on short-term self-preservation. Of their positions on the senate, and of the nation.
                They are strong advocates for authoritarianism, and efficiency.
                Lanterns, usually look towards the future. They advocate for long-term survival strategies.
                Ecological balances, technological improvements, magical research, etc. 
                Rather than chasing short-term gains, which look good on paper, they wish to optimize the nation to be self-sufficient and undestroyable. 
                Even if it would take thousands of years for their plans to bear any fruit.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Neo-Neprad's Senate has a system of decision making which allows for results in rather efficient timings. <br>
                Tier 1 Decisions are mostly routine policies; like crop rotations, drone patrol schedules, budget updates. These decisions pass automatically, 
                unless over half the senate refuses, or Sylvar vetoes within 72 hours.
                <br>
                Tier 2 Decisions are either deadlocked or divisive. Refugeee ships, conscription terms, approving experimental technology, etc. 
                These are solved by selecting 100 random adult citizens, who are given permission to observe, and ask questions to the senate about the bill directly.
                Their binding verdict must be delivered in 7 days, or Sylvar makes the choice.
                <br>
                Tier 3 Decisions deal with existential threats. Ultimatums from the Empire of Shaire, Aetherstorms, Pirate Armies, etc. 
                These require Sylvar's direct attendance to Senate meetings and require Her approval after senate review.
                Sylvar's decision is irreversible.
                <br>
                Tier 4 Decisions hold Sylvar solely accountable. They deal with issues arising between Gods, or Godlike entities within the Astral Sea or across the Realms.
                The only way to appeal a decision made by Sylvar on Tier 4 issues, is with 90% of the senate voting to ignore Her decision. 
                Meaning 63 senators must disagree with Sylvar publicly.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Transparency Doctrine dictates that all tier 1-3 decisions are streamed to the public. Critical sessions are kept private, 
                but an edited version is released to the public to improve morale.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Youth Vanguard Doctrine dictates that 10 seats on the senate must be reserved for citizens under the age of 40.
                These young senators are often-times more progressive than the rest, they advocate for tech-sharing, and making friends with neutral islands and groups.
                The majority of their proposals die quickly.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Sylvar's Spire hosts petitions which citizens can vote on. 
                These petitions are managed by the Lanterns.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Economy</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Neo-Neprad's economy is based on self-reliance and self-sufficiency.
                Trade with any entity outside the nation is a dangerous vulnerability.
                The risk is not worth taking for Neo-Neprad, so they must produce or salvage everything it needs.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; This is done through recycling everything; from scrap metals, to bodily waste, to exhaled carbon dioxide.
                For the salvaging of resources, Neo-Neprad uses "Reclamation Subs" to salvage shipwrecks, and chase Aetherstorms.
                Lacking sophisticated magical knowledge, bountiful harvests are "created" through science, chemical engineering, and genetic engineering.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The currency of Neo-Neprad are called LCs (Labour Credits). The government pays citizens LCs for the work they do.
                The higher skilled and riskier jobs pay much more than standard work.
                Refusing to work or underperforming leads to LC deductions, rationing, and more dangerous mandatory labour.
                LCs can be redeemed for anything: housing, energy quotas, food, healthcare, clothing, etc. Basic necessities are guaranteed, but comfort, and variety is earned.
                Exceptional military service, good engineering track records, and anything which greatly benefits the nation results in significant LC bonuses and being publicly praised as a hero.
                Dissent, corruption, and failing Neo-Neprad results in heavy LC penalties, social stigma, and hazardous assignments.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Senate understands that total control is impossible. So they give citizens the illusion of freedom by managing a regulated black market.
                The black market contains items from all over the Realms and is able to continue its relationship with Neo-Neprad by selling the Senate incredible amounts of information.
                Information about citizens who visit the market, and news from all the Realms.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Military</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Not much is known about their military.
                There are two branches of Neo-Neprad's military. The Navy, and the Special Operations branch.

            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The largest empire among the Realms.
                It is the size of Garna, with plenty of resources, Wild Gods, soldiers, enough greed and ambition to swallow all the Realms.
                The Empire of Shaire was the first civilization of the Astral Sea, and dates older than some of the Natural Gods.
                It is currently locked into a seemingly endless war between Neo-Neprad, the VPF, and the Sea itself.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Empire of Shaire is Monarchial and Feudalistic. The level of indoctrination is leagues ahead of Neo-Neprad's.
                Citizens of the Empire genuinely believe that it is a utopian civilization, as life underneath the flag of the Empire is quite good.
                The issues are the tactics employed in war, the genocides, and the systematic killings carried out by the inquisition.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The economy of the Astral Sea is dictated by the Empire. Over 95% of all goods which hold monetary value are in the hands of the Empire.
                The Empire itself produces gold coins, which are used as the universal currency across all civilised Realms which have merged with the Astral Sea.
                There are no industries which the Empire does not operate in and fail to produce any profits.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Empire's military is made up of an Infantry, Navy, and Inquisition. The Infantry deal with threats of rebellion across the continent of Shaire.
                The Navy deals primarily with the war against the VPF, trying to wipe them from existence. The Inquisition is an intelligence and special-operations branch of their military.
                They mostly infiltrate, spy, and systematically butcher threats to the Empire. They have full immunity from the Empire's laws, and report directly to the Emperor.
                Members of the Inquisition focus on turning neutral entities into vassals for the Empire, which the Infantry then deals with accordingly.
                In the present, the Inquisition's main goal is to successfully infiltrate Neo-Neprad.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Government</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The system of government is monarchial feudalism, ruled by an Emperor. 
                Power is delegated to a network of hereditary nobles who govern fiefdoms in exchange for military service and taxes.
                They possesses an incredibly effective propaganda machine. 
                Life within the Empire's core territories is stable, prosperous, and safe for loyal citizens. 
                As a result, citizens genuinely believe Shaire is a utopia and the pinnacle of civilization. 
                Criticism is unthinkable to the average subject. 
                The utopian image masks the extreme brutality externally and internally. It is an Empire of systematic genocide,
                against anyone deemed "unassimilable" or threats on conquered frontiers.
                The Inquisition is their state-police, it is a terror apparatus operation with total impunity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Economy</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Empire of Shaire dictates the economy of the entire Astral Sea region. 
                Holds a monopoly or overwhelming majority share (over 95%) in all valuable goods and 
                resources traded. They have their own mint: "Shaire Crown", which has been adopted across all realms as "Crowns".
                They are gold coins that are the de facto universal currency across all Realms connected to the Astral Sea. 
                This gives them immense financial leverage. They operate in every conceivable industry and runs them all at a significant profit. 
                Competition is crushed or absorbed. Efficiency and exploitation are maximized.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Military</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Infantry is made up of vast legions of Githyanki forming the backbone of their military. 
                They are primarily focused on internal security. 
                They crush rebellions within the Shaire continent, garrisonin territories, 
                and provide the main force against invasions. They are well-equipped, disciplined, and indoctrinated. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Navy is a colossal fleet dominating the Endless Sea. 
                Primarily engaged in the relentless war against the VPF, seeking their total annihilation. 
                Also secures trade routes, blockades enemies, and projects power across the Sea. 
                They blend technology with potent magic and brilliant strategy and coordination. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Empire is in alliances with a plethora of Wild Gods.
                These entities serve as incredibly powerful weapons, regional enforcers, 
                or sources of divine legitimacy and terror within the Empire's vast territories. 
                The Empire's ability to harness them fills their citizens with joy.

            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The VPF is a loose, often fractious coalition of independent pirate fleets, 
                rebel cells, and anti-imperial outcasts, unified primarily by their shared, 
                existential opposition to the Empire of Shaire's dominance. 
                They are less a single nation, more a constellation of predators and freedom fighters haunting the void. 
                It emerged from the ideals of rebellion against Shairean tyranny. 
                Inspired by figures who defied the Empire early on, 
                the VPF coalesced around the core principle of resisting Shairean absorption at all costs. 
                Survival and freedom are their rallying cries. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The structure is decentralized, fleet-based, and has shifting alliances.
                There is no single ruler or rigid hierarchy, although Roger has most authority given his power. 
                Authority stems from powerful fleet commodores, influential captains, 
                charismatic rebel leaders, and successful warlords.
                Power resides in ships. Large, well-armed flagships command smaller flotillas of raiders, 
                scouts, and support vessels. Each major fleet operates semi-autonomously.
                Fleets and cells cooperate when facing a common Shairean threat, 
                but competition for plunder, safe harbors, and resources is fierce. 
                Betrayals and temporary mergers are common. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Warfare</strong><br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The VPF are masters of hit-and-run raids, 
                ambushes in asteroid fields or nebulae, commerce raiding, and sabotage. 
                They avoid direct, fleet-to-fleet engagements with the Shairean Navy whenever possible. 
                Target Shairean merchant convoys, 
                isolated outposts, supply lines, and resource extraction operations. 
                The aim is to bleed the Empire economically and logistically, not hold territory. 
                They leverage the inherent dangers of the Astral Sea to their advantage.
                Cosmic storms, treacherous nebulae, dense asteroid belts, 
                and the monstrous creations of certain powers.
                As natural defenses and tactical advantages against the more rigid Shairean Navy. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; While piracy is core, 
                a significant faction within the VPF actively engages in supporting rebellions on Shairean-occupied worlds, 
                smuggling refugees/weapons, and striking military targets with ideological fervor. <br>
