                <strong>The Realm</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; A primal, savage world of towering ancient forests, 
                bone-dry deserts of crimson sand, mountains like shattered teeth, 
                churning acidic seas, and labyrinthine cave systems. Life is hyper-aggressive and oversized. 
                Prey animals are deadly; plants are carnivorous or toxic. 
                Resources (clean water, edible plants, safe shelter) are scarce and fiercely contested. 
                The environment itself is a constant predator.

            <p class="card-description panel">
                <strong>Soniya</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; An Elder God of unknown origin. Depicted most commonly as a tall, 
                spindly figure composed of dense black smoke forming sharp, jagged "hair." 
                Her eyes are pure, glowing white, emitting their own light. 
                Resides in an imposing, unassailable stronghold within the mythical "Third Realm," 
                a dimension layered over the physical one. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Soniya's primary interaction with all the realms is Death Games. 
                She hosts voluntary, arena-based death matches. 
                Participants come from across the multiverse seeking glory. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Soniya magically broadcasts these games everywhere. 
                Taverns, palaces, war camps, even divine realms. All can watch the carnage unfold in real-time. 
                This fuels massive gambling rings and provides universal, grim entertainment. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The only prize for victory is honor and immortality in the Museum of Heroes. 
                There are no material rewards offered by Soniya. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; The Museum of Heroes is a colossal 17-story structure within Soniya's stronghold. 
                Each floor holds towering portraits of victors, alongside preserved, 
                mounted heads or full taxidermy of the most fearsome beasts they slew within the Games. 
                It's a monument to violence and survival. <br>

                <strong>Titans</strong> <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Unlike other realms, the Realm of Beasts harbors over 30 Titans. 
                This density is unheard of and terrifying. They are the undisputed, absolute rulers. 
                Titans define the food chain. The Titans have carved up the entire realm. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Their territories are absolute. Trespassing means instant, 
                catastrophic annihilation. Their presence warps local ecosystems, 
                creating zones of extreme heat, cold, poison, or raw elemental chaos. 
                They are the reason the realm is so lethally overgrown and mutated. They are the environment. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; Merely existing means avoiding Titan notice. 
                Migration routes, settlements, and resource gathering are dictated by avoiding Titan paths and territories. 
                A Titan shifting its hunting ground is a regional extinction event. 
                The realm's "beasts" are often Titan-spawn or creatures hyper-evolved to survive near them. 
                Possessing colossal size, extreme resilience, unique predatory adaptations, or even parasitic relationships with Titan energies. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; All other Gods actively avoid the Realm of Beasts. 
                Sending avatars or divine influence risks attracting a Titan's attention. 
                A battle even Gods might lose. Soniya operates safely from Her stronghold,
                seemingly intimidating the Titans, making Her the realm's only consistent divine presence. <br>
